**Objective**: Create a system that intelligently routes below modules to the most appropriate LLM models using ML/DL-based
algorithm. This assignment is focused on developing a model that selects the optimal LLM for each of the five defined
modules, rather than implementing the modules themselves.

**Solution:**
1. Data Collection & Preparation
2. Model Development
3. Prototype Interface
4. Feedback System


**Summary:**
A fully functional LLM selection system that accurately recommends the best model for given tasks.
A scalable and explainable API that provides confident predictions.
A self-improving feedback mechanism ensuring continuous learning and refinement.
